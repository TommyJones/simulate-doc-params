# simulate-doc-params
Simulations using the data generating process modeled by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to simulate matrices of word frequencies that retain the statistical properties of human language.

The purpose of the code in this repo is to discover the range of parameters that result in realistic(ish) simulated data.
